# Welcome

## âœ¨ Welcome to the UNiD Documentation!

UNiD is an easy to implement, flexible solution to integrate **a decentralized identity middleware** into your applications. UNiD is composed of a collection of micro services, allowing developers to combine pluggable and extensible modular for flexibility and freedom of choice without compromising security. We are here to give developers and companies the building blocks they need to secure their applications without having to become security experts.
