On this page, we get you up and running with UNiD SDK, so that it will build a wallet which provides storage of cryptographic keys, credentials, and secrets on a cloud server. It is often implemented on an existing server to communicate with an identity wallet, such as authenticating or issuing credentials. At the moment, we support Node.js SDKs.

### Node.js

UNiD Node.js SDK offers easy-to-use javascript modules for embedding identity wallet capabilities such as DID operations, VC operations, and DID communications through the underlying UNiD Core APIs and Drivers.

**Prerequisites**

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- `node v13.x.x or later`
- `npm v6.13.x or later`

If you don't already have an account and UNiD tenant established, head over to [here](https://docs.getunid.io), then return to this page.

### Install

Add the `@unid/nodejs-sdk` dependency:
```bash
npm install --save @unid/nodejs-sdk
```

In UNiD, MongoDB is used as local repository (keyrings, secrets, etc) by default.
Please install and setup MongoDB in your server environment.


### Configure

After you've completed setting up a tenant and a relying party application in UNiD, UNiD will give you values: `client_id` and `client_secret`. These values are used for authorization when the RP communicates with the wallet application and SDS endpoints.

```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/nodejs-sdk";

Unid.init({
    client_id: "client_id_token",
    client_secret: "client_secret_token",
    env_network: "testnet"
});
```

Great! Now that you've completed setting up the Node SDK. You can step forward to [Generate New DID](../server/1-did-operation).
